# Deterministic backstop for command-preamble-contract.md §0: durable code, tests, and
# .knowledge/ must never reference the ephemeral planning bundle that produced them. Prose
# instructions in implement.md/pr-review.md/site-audit.md ask the agent to self-check this on
# every run; this script makes it a real, repeatable gate instead of relying on the agent
# remembering, since a leaked reference (a spec/task/quickfix ID, or the branch name itself) has
# kept recurring even with the prose instruction in place.
#
# Parity twin of scripts/powershell/check-planning-references.ps1 -- keep both in sync.
