"""Generate the current BSW.DevSpark knowledge index.

Superset of the legacy flat type-folder model (architecture/, governance/, reference/, ...,
classified by `type:` frontmatter) and the entity-ontology model
(.knowledge/entities/<id>/_entity.yaml + layer docs classified by `layer:` frontmatter).
Both models are additive and may coexist in the same repository per constitution Principle I —
adopting entities/ is an explicit, opt-in migration (see migrate-knowledge-to-entities.py), never
required for an existing repo to keep working.

# truth it contains, and is the only axis the taxonomy registry may assign. Collapsing the two
