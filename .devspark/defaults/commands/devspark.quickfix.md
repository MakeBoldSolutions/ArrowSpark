## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Workflow Position

Alternative entry point to authoring: `[user request] → route decision → { specify → clarify → plan → tasks | quickfix } → implement`. Use **instead of** `/devspark.specify` for bug fixes, config tweaks, docs updates, hotfixes, or minor features under ~4 hours. `/devspark.specify` recommends this command automatically for `one-off-fix` classification.

- **Owns**: classification, targeted constitution check, a dedicated quickfix branch (`NNN-fix-<slug>`), a temporary product-owner change record (`NNN-fix-<slug>` with WHAT/WHY/HOW), a minimal `## Context Resolution` (whatever `.knowledge/` entities/decisions the fix touches, if any), and complete `code_ref`/`knowledge_ref` linkage on the Validation Checklist. Before checking an item complete, record every affected production-code, test, and current `.knowledge/` path there; never reference the temporary quickfix record from a durable file.
- **Does NOT own**: multi-file architectural changes, new user-facing features, or API/schema changes (→ `/devspark.specify`); interactive ambiguity resolution (→ `/devspark.clarify`); design artifacts (→ `/devspark.plan`); story-organized task lists (→ `/devspark.tasks`); adversarial risk review (→ `/devspark.critic`, `/devspark.analyze`) — quickfix's lightweight contract deliberately skips both gates entirely rather than running a lighter version of either; escalate to `/devspark.specify` if the change turns out to need them.
- **If scope expands during implementation**: halt and recommend `/devspark.specify {original problem}` rather than stretching the quickfix.

## Constitution Authority

`/.knowledge/governance/constitution.md` is **required** — if missing, halt and direct the user to `/devspark.constitution`. The targeted constitution check (§5) loads only principles relevant to the detected classification, but they remain non-negotiable: a FAIL must be surfaced and acknowledged in writing, never silently ignored.

Load and obey the shared preamble contract at `/.devspark/templates/command-preamble-contract.md` (installed repos) or `templates/command-preamble-contract.md` (source repos) before step 1 — in particular §9 (Genuine Fix Discipline) when the quickfix originates from a linter/test/code-smell finding.

## Overview

This command enables rapid fixes without full-spec overhead. Its record lives under
`.devspark.work/quickfixes/` for as long as it takes to reach `/devspark.implement`, which updates
code, affected tests, and current knowledge, passes required verification, and populates the
record's `code_ref`/`knowledge_ref` linkage. The record then stays live in `.devspark.work/quickfixes/`
— `/devspark.release` is the only command that later archives it to `.archive/{YYYY-MM-DD}/quickfixes/`
once it's Complete and linkage-verified.

**Use Cases:**

- Bug fixes (runtime errors, UI glitches, data issues)
- Small features (< 4 hours estimated work)
- Production hotfixes requiring rapid deployment
- Configuration changes
- Documentation updates

**IMPORTANT**: This command creates minimal documentation and still performs constitution-aware gate checks.

Gate results from this workflow are advisory. The agent must surface blocking concerns and recommend a next action, but the user decides whether to fix first, escalate, or accept the risk.

## Prerequisites

- Project constitution at `/.knowledge/governance/constitution.md` (REQUIRED)
- Git repository with working branch

## Actions

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for action type:

| Action     | Trigger                                   | Description                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `create`   | Default (description provided)            | Create new quickfix record |
| `complete` | Legacy compatibility only | Route unfinished records through `/devspark.implement` |
| `list`     | `/devspark.quickfix list`                 | Show recent quickfixes     |

## Definition of Done

Done when (for `create`): the quickfix branch `BRANCH_NAME` is checked out when approved, the
temporary record exists at `QUICKFIX_DIR/NEXT_ID.md` with WHAT/WHY/HOW and constitution compliance,
and the final summary routes to `/devspark.implement`. `list` is read-only. `complete` must not retain
a completed record; route to implementation finalization and deletion.

## Outline

Multi-app scope and the 2-tier override check for scripts are defined by the shared preamble contract already loaded above.

### 1. Initialize Quickfix Context

Run `{SCRIPT}` to gather context and parse JSON output for:

- `REPO_ROOT`: Repository root path
- `CONSTITUTION_PATH`: Path to constitution file
- `CONSTITUTION_EXISTS`: Whether constitution exists
- `QUICKFIX_DIR`: Directory for quickfix records
- `CURRENT_BRANCH`: Current git branch
- `NEXT_ID`: Next quickfix ID (unified `NNN-fix-<slug>` format; legacy records remain readable as `QF-YYYY-NNN`)
- `BRANCH_NAME`: Branch to create for this quickfix (matches `NEXT_ID`)
- `NUMBER`: The allocated 3-digit index (pass through to `new-branch.{ps1,sh} -Number`/`--number` for an exact match)
- `SLUG`: The normalized short-name (pass through to `new-branch.{ps1,sh} -ShortName`/`--short-name` for an exact match)
- `HAS_GIT`: Whether a git repository is available (gates branch creation and commit)
- `GIT_USER`: Git username for attribution
- `TIMESTAMP`: Current UTC timestamp
- `ACTION`: Determined action (create/complete/list)
- `CLASSIFICATION`: Auto-detected classification
- `RISK_LEVEL`: Assessed risk level
- `MAX_EFFORT`: Maximum recommended effort

**Error Handling:**

If constitution doesn't exist:

- **STOP** and inform user that constitution is required
- Provide guidance: "Run `/devspark.constitution` to create project principles first"
- Do not proceed with quickfix creation

### 2. Handle Action

#### Action: `list`

If ACTION is "list":

1. Read all files from QUICKFIX_DIR
2. Parse metadata from each file
3. Display summary table:

```markdown
## Recent Quickfixes

| ID          | Date       | Classification | Status    | Description                     |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| QF-2026-003 | 2026-02-01 | bug-fix        | Completed | Fix null pointer in UserService |
| QF-2026-002 | 2026-01-28 | hotfix         | Completed | Payment timeout fix             |
| QF-2026-001 | 2026-01-25 | config-change  | Completed | Update rate limits              |
```

1. Stop execution (no record creation)

#### Action: `complete`

If ACTION is "complete" and QUICKFIX_ID is provided:

1. Read the quickfix record from `QUICKFIX_DIR/QUICKFIX_ID.md`.
2. If it does not exist, report that it was already finalized or never existed.
3. If it exists, do not mark it as completed here. Route to `/devspark.implement`, which owns
  verification and current-knowledge consistency; `/devspark.release` owns archiving the record
  under `.archive/` once it's Complete and linkage-verified.
4. Stop execution.

#### Action: `create` (Default)

Continue to step 3 for creating new quickfix record.

### 3. Validate Scope

Based on CLASSIFICATION from script:

| Classification  | Keywords Detected                       | Max Effort | Risk   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| `hotfix`        | urgent, critical, emergency, production | 2 hours    | HIGH   |
| `bug-fix`       | fix, bug, error, crash, broken, issue   | 4 hours    | MEDIUM |
| `config-change` | config, setting, environment, flag      | 1 hour     | LOW    |
| `docs-update`   | doc, readme, comment, documentation     | 2 hours    | LOW    |
| `minor-feature` | (default)                               | 4 hours    | LOW    |

**Scope Warning:**

If the description suggests work beyond the classification limits, warn:

```markdown
Scope Warning: This appears to be a larger change than a typical {CLASSIFICATION}.

Consider upgrading to a full specification:

- Run `/devspark.specify {description}` for proper planning
- Or continue with quickfix if you're confident it's small
```

### 4. Load Constitution (Targeted)

Read `/.knowledge/governance/constitution.md` and extract only principles relevant to the change type:

| Classification  | Relevant Principles                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `hotfix`        | Security, Observability, Deployment |
| `bug-fix`       | Testing, Code Quality, Security     |
| `config-change` | Security, Documentation             |
| `docs-update`   | Documentation                       |
| `minor-feature` | All MUST principles                 |

Build a targeted validation checklist from these principles only.

### 5. Constitution Compliance Check

For each relevant principle:

- **PASS**: Proposed solution complies or principle not applicable
- **CONDITIONAL**: Needs specific action to comply (document the action)
- **FAIL**: Cannot proceed without violating principle

**Compliance Decision:**

- If any FAIL: Surface the blocking concern, explain why it matters, recommend `/devspark.specify` or escalation, and ask whether to continue anyway, switch workflows, or stop. **Never auto-bypassed** — a FAIL here is a constitution violation by definition, so this always waits for a human regardless of `--auto`.
- If CONDITIONAL: Document required actions in the quickfix record. Under `--auto` (or a standing autonomy instruction), this is auto-documented and the run proceeds without asking — CONDITIONAL is not a blocker, it's a recorded follow-up.
- If all PASS: Proceed with quickfix creation.

If the user chooses to continue despite FAIL or CONDITIONAL findings, record that explicit override in the quickfix record under `## Gate Acknowledgements`.

### 6. Extract Quickfix Details (Product Owner TLDR — WHAT / WHY / HOW)

Use the **entire conversation thread** as input — not just the `$ARGUMENTS` string. Troubleshooting quickfixes are usually invoked mid-investigation, so mine the preceding turns (the reported bug, error messages, files inspected, root-cause discussion, and the fix that was agreed on) to populate a crisp product-owner-friendly summary:

- **WHAT (the problem)**: What is the current problem / observed behavior — what is broken from the user's or reporter's perspective (1-2 sentences).
- **WHY (the root cause)**: Why is this happening in the code — the underlying technical cause identified during troubleshooting (1-2 sentences). If the trigger was an automated finding (lint rule, test failure, code-smell metric), state the behavioral intent it is a proxy for, not just the raw message — see command-preamble-contract.md §9 (Genuine Fix Discipline).
- **HOW (the fix)**: How are we going to fix it — the concrete change plan agreed on in the thread (1-2 sentences). The plan must address the root cause above, not merely satisfy the check mechanically.
- **Affected Components**: Files/modules likely impacted (infer from the conversation and code already inspected).

Keep each entry plain-language and reviewable by a non-engineer product owner. If any of WHAT/WHY/HOW cannot be determined from the thread, state the open question explicitly rather than inventing an answer.

### 7. Confirm, Then Create the Quickfix Branch

Working on an isolated branch keeps the record and the fix together — but **DevSpark must never create or switch branches without explicit confirmation** (see the Branch Safety rule in the preamble contract). Branch creation for every DevSpark route (including quickfixes) funnels through the single `new-branch.{ps1,sh}` script (spec 001-unified-new-branch) — never run `git checkout -b` directly here.

If `HAS_GIT` is false, skip branching entirely, note it in the summary, and write the record on the current working tree.

Otherwise:

1. If the working tree is already on a `NNN-fix-*` (or legacy `QF-*`) branch from a prior run, **stay on it** (no new branch, no switch) and continue.
2. If the working tree has **uncommitted changes**, warn the developer first — switching would carry those changes onto the new branch. Let them commit, stash, or decide before proceeding.
3. Show exactly what will happen and ask: **"Create and switch to branch `{BRANCH_NAME}` from `{CURRENT_BRANCH}`? (yes / stay on current branch)"**
   - **Wait for an explicit yes.** This confirmation is **required even under `--auto`** — creating/switching a branch is a working-context change that must be a human decision.
   - On **yes**: run `new-branch.{ps1,sh}` with `-Type fix -Number {NUMBER} -ShortName {SLUG} -Yes -Json` (bash: `--type fix --number {NUMBER} --short-name {SLUG} --yes --json`) — reusing the exact `NUMBER`/`SLUG` already shown so the created branch matches `{BRANCH_NAME}` precisely. `-Yes`/`--yes` is safe here because the confirmation above already satisfied Branch Safety; the script performs the audited `git checkout -b` and scaffolds a placeholder record at its `ARTIFACT_PATH`, which step 8 immediately overwrites with the full record.
   - On **no / stay**: do not create or switch; write the record on the current branch and note that choice in the summary.

Do **not** create the branch before the constitution compliance check (§5) resolves — a blocking FAIL must be surfaced first.

### 8. Generate Quickfix Record

Ensure directory exists: Create `/.devspark.work/quickfixes/` if missing.

Create record at `QUICKFIX_DIR/NEXT_ID.md`:

```markdown
---
classification: one-off-fix
risk_level: { RISK_LEVEL }
target_workflow: quickfix
required_artifacts: quickfix-record
recommended_next_step: implement
required_gates: { Leave blank for low risk; otherwise checklist }
---

# Quickfix Record: {NEXT_ID}

## Metadata

- **ID**: {NEXT_ID}
- **Created**: {TIMESTAMP}
- **Author**: {GIT_USER}
- **Branch**: {CURRENT_BRANCH}
- **Classification**: {CLASSIFICATION}
- **Risk Level**: {RISK_LEVEL}
- **Max Effort**: {MAX_EFFORT}

## TLDR (Product Owner)

- **WHAT (the problem)**: {Plain-language description of the current problem / observed behavior — what is broken}
- **WHY (the root cause)**: {Why this is happening in the code — the underlying technical cause}
- **HOW (the fix)**: {How we are going to fix it — the agreed change plan}

## Affected Components

- {Inferred file/module 1}
- {Inferred file/module 2}

## Context Resolution

{One line per `.knowledge/` entity or `governance/decisions/` doc this fix touches, e.g. `- entities/token_service (direct)`. Leave as "None — no existing knowledge touched" if genuinely none apply; do not fabricate entries.}

## Constitution Compliance

| Principle              | Status           | Notes                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| {Relevant Principle 1} | PASS/CONDITIONAL | {Notes if conditional} |
| {Relevant Principle 2} | PASS/CONDITIONAL | {Notes}                |

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Change addresses stated problem (code_ref: pending | knowledge_ref: pending)
- [ ] No unintended side effects identified
- [ ] Relevant tests updated/added (if applicable) (code_ref: pending | knowledge_ref: n/a)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable) (code_ref: n/a | knowledge_ref: pending)

## Gate Acknowledgements

{Leave blank unless the user explicitly proceeds past a blocking or conditional concern}

## Implementation Notes

{Space for developer notes during implementation - leave blank initially}

## Completion

- **Completed**: {Leave blank - filled by implement's Finalize Every Route}
- **Commit**: {Leave blank - filled by implement's Finalize Every Route}
- **PR**: {Leave blank - filled by create-pr once the PR is opened}

```

### 9. Commit Quickfix Record

If `HAS_GIT` is true, stage and commit the new record on the quickfix branch so the fix starts from a clean, traceable checkpoint. Compose the commit message from the WHAT/WHY/HOW summary captured in §6 (not a generic message):

1. Stage only the record: `git add {QUICKFIX_DIR}/{NEXT_ID}.md`.
2. Commit with a message of the form:

   ```text
   quickfix({NEXT_ID}): {one-line WHAT summary}

   WHY: {root cause in the code}
   HOW: {planned fix}
   ```

3. If `HAS_GIT` is false, skip the commit and tell the user the record was written but not committed (no git available).

Do not stage unrelated working-tree changes — commit the record only. The actual code fix is committed later by the user as they iterate.

### 10. Output Summary

Display to user:

````markdown
Quickfix Record Created: {NEXT_ID}

- **Classification**: {CLASSIFICATION}
- **Risk Level**: {RISK_LEVEL}
- **Constitution Check**: PASS ({N} principles validated)
- **Branch**: {BRANCH_NAME} (created & checked out) | current branch (git unavailable)

Record saved: /.devspark.work/quickfixes/{NEXT_ID}.md
Record committed: {commit SHA} | not committed (git unavailable)

## TLDR

- **WHAT**: {problem}
- **WHY**: {root cause}
- **HOW**: {fix}

## Gate Result

```yaml
gate: quickfix
status: pass | warn | fail
blocking: true | false
severity: info | warning | error | showstopper
summary: "Targeted constitution check complete"
```

## Next Steps

1. Iterate on the fix on branch `{BRANCH_NAME}` — apply the change described in HOW, then commit as you go
2. Run tests to verify the fix
3. Update the record's Implementation Notes as the fix evolves; if WHAT/WHY/HOW change, keep the TLDR accurate
4. Mark record complete: `/devspark.quickfix complete {NEXT_ID}`
5. Create PR — prefer `/devspark.create-pr` so the PR reflects quickfix context and any recorded gate acknowledgements
6. If creating manually, verify `{BRANCH_NAME}` is in sync with the target branch (usually `main`) before opening the PR

If scope expands beyond {MAX_EFFORT}:

- Upgrade to full spec: `/devspark.specify {problem statement}`
````

## Guidelines

### Scope Creep Detection

If during implementation the user mentions scope expansion:

- "Also need to change..."
- "This is more complex than expected..."
- "Need to refactor..."
- Multiple files/modules affected

Recommend upgrading:

```markdown
Scope Expansion Detected

Your quickfix may be growing beyond the {CLASSIFICATION} classification.
Consider upgrading to a full specification for better tracking:

/devspark.specify {original problem statement}

This ensures proper planning and documentation for larger changes.
```

### Quickfix vs Full Spec Decision Guide

| Scenario                             | Recommendation    |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Single file change, < 50 lines       | Quickfix          |
| Bug with clear root cause            | Quickfix          |
| Production issue needing rapid fix   | Quickfix (hotfix) |
| Multiple files, architectural impact | Full Spec         |
| New user-facing feature              | Full Spec         |
| Database schema changes              | Full Spec         |
| API contract changes                 | Full Spec         |

### Error Handling

**Constitution missing:**

```markdown
Cannot perform quickfix - Constitution required

The project constitution defines validation criteria. Create one first:

1. Run: /devspark.constitution
2. Define your project's core principles
3. Then retry: /devspark.quickfix {description}

Learn more: https://dev.azure.com/bswdev/HealthSource/_git/bsw.devspark
```

**High Risk Classification:**

For `hotfix` classification with HIGH risk:

```markdown
High-Risk Quickfix Warning

This has been classified as a hotfix with HIGH risk level.

Before proceeding:

- [ ] Confirm this is truly urgent
- [ ] Identify rollback plan if fix fails
- [ ] Notify team of incoming production change

Proceed with caution. Consider pair review for critical fixes.
```

### ID Format

Quickfix IDs follow the unified branch-creation format (spec 001-unified-new-branch): `NNN-fix-<slug>`

- `NNN`: The repo-wide derived index, shared with spec/quick-spec branches and zero-padded to 3 digits (001, 002, ... 999) — never a stored counter.
- `fix`: Fixed type tag identifying this as a quickfix.
- `<slug>`: A normalized short-name derived from the description (up to 4 words).

Example: `042-fix-null-guard-on-parse`.

Legacy `QF-YYYY-NNN` records (year-scoped, reset annually) created before this change remain readable and are still counted by the allocator so new indexes never collide with them.
