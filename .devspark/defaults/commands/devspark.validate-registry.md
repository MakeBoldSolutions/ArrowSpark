$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

Run comprehensive validation on the BSW.DevSpark multi-app registry. This is a **read-only** command — no files are modified.

1. **Load the registry** from `.devspark.work/devspark.registry.json`:
   - If the file does not exist, report: "No multi-app registry found."
   - If the file is invalid JSON, report the parse error and stop

2. **Schema validation**:
   - Check `version` is 1
   - Check `mode` is "multi-app"
   - Check `profiles` is an object
   - Check `apps` is an array
   - Check the repo-facts half (`platform`/`organization`/`project`/`repository`/`policies`) if present in the same file — reported as non-blocking warnings, e.g. an unrecognized `platform` value or a non-boolean `policies.protect_main` (quickfix item #2; previously this half was never checked at all). Static JSON Schemas for both halves are available at `.devspark/templates/devspark-config.schema.json` and `.devspark/templates/devspark-registry.schema.json` for editor autocomplete/validation.

3. **Identity validation**:
   - Check all app `id` values are unique, lowercase, and path-safe
   - Check all app `path` values point to existing directories

4. **Reference validation**:
   - Check all `inherits` entries reference declared profiles
   - Check all `dependsOn` entries reference declared app IDs
   - Detect cyclic dependencies and report the cycle path

5. **App-local manifest validation** (`app.json`):
   - For each app, check if `{path}/app.json` exists
   - If present, validate schema (only `tags`, `hints`, `rules` allowed)
   - Warn if identity fields are present (they will be ignored)
   - Check rules for weakening of mandatory repo-wide rules

6. **Constitution validation**:
   - Check that `.knowledge/governance/constitution.md` exists
   - For each app with a local constitution, run weakening detection

7. **Report results**:
   - List all errors (blocking issues)
   - List all warnings (non-blocking advisories)
   - Print pass/fail status
   - Structured output suitable for CI pipeline consumption

## Output Format

```text

## Constraints

- This command is read-only — no files may be created or modified
- Usable as a pre-merge check by running `/devspark.validate-registry` from an agent chat session
