# BSW.DevSpark Prompt Templates

<!-- BSW.DevSpark — © 2026 Baylor Scott & White Health. Source: https://bsw-devspark.bswhive.com -->

This directory contains the **core deliverable** of BSW.DevSpark — prompt templates that give AI coding assistants structured commands for specification-driven development.

## Commands (`commands/`)

Each file in `commands/` is a slash-command prompt (e.g., `/devspark.specify`, `/devspark.plan`). The quickstart install (`quickstart/devspark_quickstart_*.md`) deploys stock prompts to `.devspark/defaults/commands/`. AI shims then resolve prompts via the 3-tier order: personal override, team override, then stock default.

Terminology used by these templates:

- **Prompt** files are BSW.DevSpark workflow command surfaces.
- **Agents** are AI runtime or client integrations that execute prompts.
- **Skills** are portable capability packages prompts may delegate to.
- **Participants** are human or AI-filled team members responsible for work,
  review, critique, approval, or decision capture.
- **Roles** are responsibility labels for participants, such as owner, planner,
  implementer, reviewer, critic, or scribe.

BSW.DevSpark ownership follows four roots:

- `.devspark/` is framework-managed stock content
- `.devspark.work/` contains temporary plans, operations, configuration, and overrides
- `.knowledge/` contains current authoritative truth plus published user-facing guidance (`.knowledge/guides/`)
- `.archive/` is the landing place for all old work products, grouped by release

The collection includes 33 active commands.

The stock spec, quick-spec, plan, and tasks templates include optional
`participants` YAML frontmatter examples. This metadata is advisory
responsibility context only. It is not required for existing artifacts, does
not affect prompt or script resolution, and does not change command output.
Customization layers and precedence are unchanged.
