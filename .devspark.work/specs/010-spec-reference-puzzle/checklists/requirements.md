# Specification Quality Checklist: The ArrowSpark Reference Puzzle and Level Groups

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Frontmatter matches the shared validation contract
- [x] Required headings for the selected route are present in canonical order
- [x] Status line uses a valid lifecycle state
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (3 open: large-canvas group, Next Puzzle across groups/main-menu start, numbering — bounded, seed `/devspark.clarify`)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Domain terms (arrow, catalog, solver, analyzer, Open Move) are product vocabulary of this game, not implementation leakage.
- Human-playtest criteria (SC-002–SC-006, SC-009) cannot be automated; the spec must not reach Complete without them.
- The three remaining markers are the maximum allowed and are deliberately left for `/devspark.clarify`.
